The metrics are root mean square error (r_mean_se), root median square error (r_median_se), mean percentage error (mean_pe), median percentage error (median_pe), mean error (mean_e), median error (median_e), percentage error lower whisker (l_whisker), percentage error upper whisker (u_whisker).  Finally, aggregates.json is a derivative of statements.json - structurally different."
